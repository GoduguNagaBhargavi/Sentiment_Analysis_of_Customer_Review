# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Customer_Review
# Problem Statement:
Develop a Sentiment Analysis model to classify Reviews as Positive or Negative. Preprocess the review text using techniques such as Lower casing, Removing stop words and Lemmatization. Use the Trained model accurately to predict the Sentiment of New and Unseen Reviews.
# Proposed Solution:
The proposed system aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning model that can automatically classify customer reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. This solution seeks to provide businesses with actionable insights from customer feedback, enabling them to enhance customer satisfaction, improve products and services, and make informed, data-driven decisions. 
# Results:

The bar plot illustrates the distribution of sentiment-related words within the reviews. Words like 'good', 'great', 'amazing', and 'love' appear frequently, suggesting positive sentiments associated with these terms. Conversely, words like 'bad' indicate instances of negative sentiment. The varying heights of the bars indicate the relative frequency of each word, providing insight into the overall sentiment expressed in the reviews dataset. The color coding helps differentiate between different words for clarity and emphasis.

Accuracy: The classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.8 (80%), indicating that it correctly predicted the sentiment for 80% of the reviews in the dataset.
Classification Report: The classification report summarizes the sentiment analysis model's performance with an accuracy of 80%, indicating its ability to correctly classify reviews into positive or negative sentiments. Precision scores of 0.76 for negative sentiment and 0.85 for positive sentiment demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting each sentiment class. Balanced recall scores of 0.85 for negative sentiment and 0.75 for positive sentiment show the model's capability to capture actual instances of each sentiment category. Overall, with consistent F1-scores of 0.80, the model achieves reliable performance across both precision and recall metrics, affirming its effectiveness in sentiment classification tasks.
